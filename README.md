This is a personal project to explore audio processing with c++, in which I intend to implement functions to add reverb, distortion, and other fun audio tricks.

As of now, this project only supports processing with 16 bit wav files. I am running this code on a system running Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS, and am not testing it on other system types.

File 'TODO.txt' tracks goals for this project.

Dependencies:
- fftw3 -> http://www.fftw.org
- gnuplot-iostream -> https://github.com/dstahlke/gnuplot-iostream
