TODO
----
Add set_data to WavFile.cpp, which sets the data part of the wavfile to an input vector. This vector can be float and is normalized to int16_t
convolve.cpp
    Change impulse from unordered map to vector of pairs
add_reverb.cpp
    add two channel support
change delay vector to vector of pairs to increase speed (many zeroes in delay vector)
ImpulseResponse.cpp
filter.cpp (low/band/high pass)
downsample.cpp

Longterm:
Implement bitcrush.cpp
    Not happy with sound. Look into downsampling instead of just dividing each sample
Implement generate_noise.cpp (can make white noise, filter for other types of noise)
Implement mix R/L channels
combine.cpp ?
Implement distortion.cpp (not sure how this will work)

~

Complete
----
Organize files into src folder
Implement fft to plot audio freq spec with cpp
Figure out how to plot in cpp with plot_samples.cpp
Implement fill_out.cpp
Add ratio of original sample to delayed in add_delay.cpp
Clean up WavFile class
Fix WavFile.print_header()
